-- markdown doesn't really have comments. 
-- The default is html comments <!-- ... -->.
-- For making tex documents with the markdown package it is possible to ignore latex comments, hence:

-- c=continue comment when wrapping. Should already be enabled.
-- r=with enter in insert mode. Should already be enabled.
-- o=with o/O in normal mode. Not sure if I want this.
-- a=auto format by default
-- v=inserted now, don't edit other lines.

-- this also had to be set for the above to understand how a comment line looks.
-- the b means the % should always be followed by a blank, i.e. space
opt.comments = "b:%"
-- ai is necessary for lists but a problem if I try to indent start of sentence, then the next lines are also indented.
-- opt.autoindent = false
-- since we are actively using the textwidth in markdown then the moving of the window is just annoying for a slim window
