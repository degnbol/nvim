Set up completion with LSP: https://alpha2phi.medium.com/new-neovim-completion-plugins-you-should-try-b5e1a3661623
Make julia LSP faster with https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md#julials
If you get LSP diagnostics to become good then you can add toggling with WhoIsSethDaniel/toggle-lsp-diagnostics.nvim
If you want to be able to open nvim within nvim terminal it can be done without nesting: https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote see bottom of https://github.com/caenrique/nvim-toggle-terminal
Consider https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R and https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline
Consider https://github.com/seblj/nvim-tabline and https://github.com/alvarosevilla95/luatab.nvim . NvimTree can have keymaps customized to use tabs rather than buffers https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua

Try different terminals for effect on scrolling in the main doc.
Going back to iron repl over pappasam since the later started having some indents being created issues for python.
Iron shows an error first time it is opened if opened with <CR>motion but otherwise works fine so far.
The indention issue happens in .tex files as well when I write \usepackage{ it indents the line twice. Might be a tree sitter issue.
Enable completion at least for filenames.
Enter in commandline mode or the Ex mode is annoying. Anyway to make sure the enter to run in repl is only for normal mode while editing a file?
