see video again from kitty main page and implement super useful things, e.g. the thing that let's you edit remote files locally.

Maybe move around vim and kitty windows more seamlessly

Check out https://github.com/ms-jpq/isomorphic_copy

Hide last search if / or ? is used as textobj, e.g. y/\. that yanks sentence that may go on for multiple lines.

Telescope filter underfull overfull and warnings in latex.

line.

features: leader+t+p to toggle pipe notation in julia, leader+t+f toggling between inline function, regular and begin/end and other toggles could be useful.
Maybe move toggles to g+t+... and use leader+t for term stuff?
