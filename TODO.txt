If you get LSP diagnostics to become good then you can add toggling with WhoIsSethDaniel/toggle-lsp-diagnostics.nvim
Consider https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R and https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline
Consider https://github.com/seblj/nvim-tabline and 
customized to use tabs rather than buffers

Enter in commandline mode or the Ex mode is annoying. Anyway to make sure the

color theme according to terminal color theme but with an option to use the 
hardcoded tested color theme so we don't end up with a broken theme.

see video again from kitty main page and implement super useful things, e.g. the thing that let's you edit remote files locally.

Maybe move around vim and kitty windows more seamlessly

Check out https://github.com/ms-jpq/isomorphic_copy
to deal with clipboard on remote. Ideally use kitty kittens tho.

Hide last search if / or ? is used as textobj, e.g. y/\. that yanks sentence that may go on for multiple lines.

Telescope filter underfull overfull and warnings in latex.

If possible. In latex, and maybe in general, only autoformat simple text, i.e. not code, lists, and anything indented.

Very annoying: when autocompleting on the fo=a autoformats, the completion is duplicated on the new line.

Syntax coloring messed up in latex probs due to conceal.

markid better syntax highlighting

Write lua function to add a line with word under cursor to spell/custom.dic
then maybe update cmp to understand the word has been added.
Then you can add unknown (lots of scientific) words to your dictionary.
Add a keybinding in whichkey

BUG: scrolling in nvim tree turns it into another buffer.

add useful things to mouse.


play with cypher syntax highlight.
Automatically uppercase cypher keywords like a spell check word replacement call?
Or make a command to toggle entire doc between uppercase and lowercase keywords.
It is nice that they are uppercase if you read without syntax highlighting but 
no need when they are colored.
