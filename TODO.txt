Then have ability to make theme persist. we probs won't change often, except for dark vs light.
Auto switch away from dark theme if we select light theme?
Would also be cool to only list dark or light themes in treesitter.

splitjoin shouldn't have issue splitting when there is a comment in a lua block for instance.

consider something like auto indent pasted text as more default or more accessible since we fix it so often.
Maybe too much to have it as default but we could use shift+= (+, I never use it) as alone `[ to `] 
and something in insert mode which may already exists, just like I already had =p for formatted paste from unimpaired.

color theme according to terminal color theme but with an option to use the 
hardcoded tested color theme so we don't end up with a broken theme.

BUG: scrolling in nvim tree turns it into another buffer.
Alt tree browsers: https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim
https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/

tex cmd trying to ctrl+t \texttt the whole text within an \href surrounds the whole \href cmd. It shouldnt.



If you get LSP diagnostics to become good then you can add toggling with WhoIsSethDaniel/toggle-lsp-diagnostics.nvim
Consider https://github.com/seblj/nvim-tabline and 
customized to use tabs rather than buffers
https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua
Delete button cuts, but should just delete. Fixed for backspace now using black hole register.

see video again from kitty main page and implement super useful things, e.g. the thing that let's you edit remote files locally.
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

Maybe move around vim and kitty windows more seamlessly
https://github.com/knubie/vim-kitty-navigator

Check out https://github.com/ms-jpq/isomorphic_copy
to deal with clipboard on remote. Ideally use kitty kittens tho.

Hide last search if / or ? is used as textobj, e.g. y/\. that yanks sentence that may go on for multiple lines.

Telescope filter underfull overfull and warnings in latex.

markid better syntax highlighting

consider colortheme https://github.com/nealmckee/penumbra

add useful things to mouse. I don't want to use it too much but maybe some 
things that are hard to remember or where mouse movement is natural.

Make writing guitar tabs easy.

play with cypher syntax highlight.
Automatically uppercase cypher keywords like a spell check word replacement call?
Or make a command to toggle entire doc between uppercase and lowercase keywords.
It is nice that they are uppercase if you read without syntax highlighting but 
no need when they are colored. This applies to other query languages as well, 
sql for instance.

Checkout https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x53lzx/i_must_be_missing_something/

make tables in latex nice to edit, similar to tsv files.

make legendary listing of keybindings to also serve as help for remembering 
e.g. m[a-zA-Z] is mark, then `[a-zA-Z] or '[a-zA-Z] to go to mark or marked 
line.

features: leader+t+p to toggle pipe notation in julia, leader+t+f toggling between inline function, regular and begin/end and other toggles could be useful.
Maybe move toggles to g+t+... and use leader+t for term stuff?

look more into editing remote files with nvim from local without using kitten for it.
Purpose:
1) browse the actual remote folder instead of a local temp folder.
2) indenpendence from kitty so we can use any terminal.

there seem to be some nice util functions you can use at https://gitlab.com/jrop/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/my/utils.lua#L27

consider if x and d should be swapped, since d's natural role is cut, so then only x will be non-standard.

Still not happy with autopairs. E.g. { at end of line where I have something on next line that I intend to put inside {}.
Or finishing an unclosed quote in lua seems like an obvious case not to introduce a new pair of "".

Would be cool if viv and vik could understand when = is inside arg and then do intersect of itself and via.
I downloaded the key/value text objs as a starting point in lua/textobjects/keyvalue.lua.

Custom completion sources, e.g. valid string values for ggplot, e.g. annotate and guide="none" or direction="vertical"
inspiration from youtuber showing custom cmp source:
https://github.com/wincent/wincent/blob/2d926177773f/aspects/nvim/files/.config/nvim/lua/wincent/cmp/handles.lua

conceal \textcolor in tex and show the contained color in the chosen color.

highlight _ that is outside math env with ERROR color in tex.

https://github.com/amarakon/nvim-cmp-lua-latex-symbols
OR https://github.com/kdheepak/cmp-latex-symbols


figure out better system for join and reverse join, we have 3 different plugins or more for it.

autoswap for kitty? or just allow editing file in multiple windows.
