// The "spacing" controls spacing between words, and "tracking" controls spacing between characters.
// "spacing" is set to defaults and "tracking" to their suggested values, however default is zero.
#set par(justify: true, justification-limits: (
    spacing: (min: 100% * 2 / 3, max: 150%),
    tracking: (min: -0.01em, max: 0.02em),
))

// Maybe set this to have horizontal division when inline and vertical in block mode.
// That would replicate the default of latex, but not sure if needed.
