Startup is changed by Lazy, the following may be outdated.
See `:h initialization` for order of calls under startup.
Broadly
 - init.lua runs lua/ files.
 - ftplugin/
 - plugins has a similar structure so may run code at all kinds of timings.
   See their code in `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/`
 - seems after/ is never run?
 - after/.../

ctrl+f(oward) and ctrl+b(ack) to navigate hover windows.
K to jump to definition in help docs and ctrl+o to go back. With lsp attached 
we remap K to show hover, and double K to move cursor into hover.
ctrl+e(extra) and ctrl+y(ester) to move screen.
zz to center line in screen, zt to put it at top of screen and zb for bottom.

miller (mlr) syntax highlighting added from https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/tree/main/vim
to ftdetect/mlr.vim and syntax/mlr.vim
It can also be done as a plugin with packer:
use {"johnkerl/miller", ft="mlr", rtp="vim"}
but it seemed the ftdetect was overridden to "conf" and it requires all of 
miller git be cloned so a bit much. ftdetect/mlr.vim probs won't need updating, 
other files probs won't be added and I don't edit miller files that much so it 
seems fine to update manually with copy paste with
```bash
./update.sh
```

word count: g then ctrl+g

multiline search with :S in-place of / (see plugin/search.vim)

Last macro can be repeated with @@
Last command with @: which also can take a count.

vim has builtin completion of a whole line.
Start to write a line written somewhere before in the file.
Press <C-x><C-l> (:h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L) and you get completion window.

ctrl+] is default vim go-to-definition.

enter replace mode with R in normal mode or Ins in insert mode.
Useful for when text is aligned with excess whitespace.

```
unjump with ``, go to last edit with `.,
go to last insert mode location with `^.
Jump along change list with g; and g,
```
In visual: o to go to opposite of selection with cursor. 
O in visual block to switch corners.
g+<C-a> is like <C-a> (increment numbers), but increments one higher for each 
occurence. Use count so it jumps more than 1 for each occurence.

ZZ to quit. ZQ to force.

Select mode. In-between visual and regular text editor selection.
It replaces the text and goes to insert mode if you press e.g. backspace.
Access it with gh (charwise) or gH (linewise) by default. Used by luasnip for 
filling out placeholder text.

A lot of multicursor stuff can be replaced with search/replace, block visual, 
and ex command :g/pattern/ex or selection lines then :norm
:g can also be used with norm, then <C-g> to see which column you are on and 
easily start the command from the relevant column. In order to do e.g. <esc> 
you will have to use ecaped :exe, e.g. if it is with :g then
:g/pattern/exe "ihello\<Esc>dw"

In quickfix (e.g. opens when you gd on something that may be defined multiple 
places or gr on something referenced multiple places), you can press c-v 
instead of enter to open the location in a new split instead of jumping away 
from where you were.

If you want cursor to move with indent/deindent, then use the insert mode mappings. If you 
want to keep cursor where it is, then use normal mappings.
Insert mode mappings: <C-d>, <C-t> and <C-f> (see :h i_CTRL-T etc.)
