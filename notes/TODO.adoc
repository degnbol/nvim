Colorscheme overhaul. Functional and simpler.
E.g. values such as numbers are currently coloured similar to types.
Should instead be similar to strings, which are also simple dataformats, and things like `None` in python which are builtin simple values.
Docstrings should also be coloured similar to strings, e.g. somewhere between string and comment. Also, keywords and statements are currently red while function calls are blue. This is two very different colours, however what is function and what is statement is not very different and gets overlapping by language. Also there's `repeat` which is almost the same colour, and the import or include keywords as well.
All of these could probably be more similar in colour, which would work ok because the keywords are still distinguished by being italic.
character.special could also be more similar to character and character could also be in between string and the color for numbers/boolean/"None"/etc.
We also have to think about the colour wheel. E.g. if we want function to be some kind of blue and string to be some kind of green, then they are right next to each other in terms of hue. Then if we want numbers to be a colour between string and statement/keyword, which e.g. is purple, then the number will become blue and clash with function. For this reason it might make sense to make some choice along the hue about which concepts should be next to each other. With parameters, which are bit like variables but also flags, and import statements which are keywords, and types are a bit like variables or sometimes can be called like functions, and filenames and directory names which should have same colour outside in term, and are a bit like strings but also relate to Include and @import, I think if you draw a diagram of all the concepts and how they relate to each other there will be almost just one way to place them along hue, with lightness+saturation being a matter of indicating important, e.g. the torch in torch. should be dim.
Delimiters doesn't have to have same color as keyword/statement. keyword operator probably don't need to be bold.
Executable files in term could be highlighted blue like functions inside nvim.

OMFG stop basedpyright lsp from goto def going to build/ dir
 
Simplify config.
Ideas:
- we currently have mini.files, nvim-tree (or nvim-neo-tree?), and now fyler getting set up. We should probably aim to only use tree explorer.
  - There's also oil.nvim with a similar role.
- fzf-lua, telescope are both installed. See if we can use only fzf-lua, or mini.pick or snacks.picker.
- colorscheme stuff is complex and messy. Lots is loaded globally that's only relevant to some filetypes. Also, I think nvim loads twice because of some colorscheme config. That's not ideal. There's some plugins that may be of use, if we don't mind adding another plugin.
- There is git diffing with Gitsigns diffthis and Diffview. We use Gitsigns for hunk navigation and previews I think, which is useful. Can we get rid of diffview, and just have one diffing tool?

Try out snacks.picker in place of fzf-lua.
Why? fzf lua was supposed to be fast but doesn't always seem that fast, plus things like oldfiles/recent doesn't give me the buffer I literally just closed, then what is the point.

Highlight final \ in python at EOL

Change to or add british English dict.

Consider adding plugin that allows for undoing for a line selection.
https://github.com/SunnyTamang/select-undo.nvim

Maybe make a simple snippet for gcc on blank line -> whatever commentchar for the filetype

Map insert mode cmd+v (<D-v> doesn't seem to work) to align after pasting linewise.
Once again, the logic is I'm more opposed to changing default vim normal cmds than things like cmd+v and arrows that aren't vim.

Make TSV plugin, the hiding and aligning functionality is quite useful.

TSV plugin optional: have title row stay in view when you scroll down into large table. Togglable.

lr in latex makes left right even in table header. Shouls only be in math.

% isn't escaped when pasting tsv into latex, e.g. when indicating actual percentage.

COOL: when pasting tsv, maybe add dummy column alignment rules or infer them from datatype (text = left, number = right, long cell=X)
Number includes Â± char

FIXME: fix .sh icon yet again.

When opening a new ipython REPL with leader tT it doesn't activate the right 
env. Possibly because it doesn't understand autoenv.

FIXME: understand the runtime in terms of colorscheme etc. zshFunction and 
operator are linked to none.
We want to change them to link to function and operator. Some things in syntax/ 
are getting applied, things in after/syntax are not. We don't want options to 
be ignored, maybe by the double setting of the colorscheme.
NOTE: it sometimes helps to use `hi! default` instead of `hi`

Could browse files with
https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim

splitjoin shouldn't have issue splitting when there is a comment in a lua block for instance.

Alt tree browsers:
https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim
https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim

tex cmd trying to ctrl+t \texttt the whole text within an \href surrounds the whole \href cmd. It shouldnt.

You can toggle LSP diagnostics with:

Consider https://github.com/seblj/nvim-tabline and 
customized to use tabs rather than buffers

see video again from kitty main page and implement super useful things, e.g. the thing that let's you edit remote files locally.
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

Maybe move around vim and kitty windows more seamlessly
https://github.com/knubie/vim-kitty-navigator

Check out https://github.com/ms-jpq/isomorphic_copy
to deal with clipboard on remote. Ideally use kitty kittens tho.

markid better syntax highlighting

play with cypher syntax highlight.
Automatically uppercase cypher keywords like a spell check word replacement call?
Or make a command to toggle entire doc between uppercase and lowercase keywords.
It is nice that they are uppercase if you read without syntax highlighting but 
no need when they are colored. This applies to other query languages as well, 
sql for instance.

Checkout https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x53lzx/i_must_be_missing_something/

make legendary listing of keybindings to also serve as help for remembering 
e.g. m[a-zA-Z] is mark, then `[a-zA-Z] or '[a-zA-Z] to go to mark or marked 
line.

features: leader+leader+p to toggle pipe notation in julia, leader+leader+i 
toggling between inline function, regular and begin/end and other toggles could 
be useful. Currently made some macros.
I think some of the julia cool things you want like convert string to/from 
symbol, inline vs not inline function etc are what are called code actions.

look more into editing remote files with nvim from local without using kitten for it.
Purpose:
1) browse the actual remote folder instead of a local temp folder.
2) indenpendence from kitty so we can use any terminal.

there seem to be some nice util functions you can use at https://gitlab.com/jrop/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/my/utils.lua#L27

consider if x and d should be swapped, since d's natural role is cut, so then only x will be non-standard.

Would be cool if viv and vik could understand when = is inside arg and then do intersect of itself and via.
I downloaded the key/value text objs as a starting point in lua/textobjects/keyvalue.lua.

Custom completion sources, e.g. valid string values for ggplot, e.g. annotate and guide="none" or direction="vertical"
inspiration from youtuber showing custom cmp source:
https://github.com/wincent/wincent/blob/2d926177773f/aspects/nvim/files/.config/nvim/lua/wincent/cmp/handles.lua

highlight _ that is outside math env with ERROR color in tex.

Consider cmdline completion for e.g. search:
https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/Menu-Appearance
https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-cmdline

autoswap for kitty? or just allow editing file in multiple windows.

consider:
https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim

Would be cool to only list dark or light themes in :Treesitter colorscheme.
I made a small temp solution with multiple user events but it doesn't deal with 
requiring plugins with both light and dark colorscheme or to unlist loaded ones later.

In case you want to auto switch comment (commentstring) in markdown with code 
sections:

The U key. It undos all changes in the line. I have never used it.
We could remap to redo or something else more useful.
We can still have undo line by remapping Vu to undo line. 
Default for visual is lowercase and uppercase for u and U.
But the normal mode gu and gU works just fine as well and we again never use this.

try out https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim
instead of leap, or the mini version
https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-jump2d.md

abb hic to Hi-C shouldn't happen in code, maybe have abbrevs you set for prose 
filetypes only or do something with snippets that only expand in prose or 
comments.

add snippets or custom completion for writing luasnippets, reference:
https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md

Also, either find out how to have a snip replace the entire line, always, or 
write custom completion source that has more control, in order to do this.
Relevant for req/import/using statements etc that I generally write with one thing per line.

Would be cool to have essentially zsh/bash LSP, where gf works for paths even 
if they are using env variables defined in the same script or if using e.g.
```
"`git root`/src/hello.jl"
```

FIXME: horixontal scroll lag, e.g. ~/Documents/phd/Chromatin/Pub/Su_2020/hicVsImg.jl

Low priority. Forward and reverse search in typst inspired by vimtex.

vimscript (at least neovim vimscript 8) is a lot slower than lua so migrate as 
much as possible of .vim files to lua. This will also make the repo a bit 
cleaner since you often have two files that are essentially filling the same 
role, e.g. ftplugin/<lang>.{vim,lua}

Cool: make completion in latex for acronyms/glossaries e.g. for \ac{} from acro

If you switch to c-n and c-p for completion instead of tab, then you can use 
tab for https://github.com/abecodes/tabout.nvim which could be a useful 
movement even along side your own shift-space.

Maybe get cool postfix snippets etc for rust while learning it:
https://github.com/TwIStOy/luasnip-snippets

checkout
https://github.com/gabrielpoca/replacer.nvim

https://github.com/danielfalk/smart-open.nvim

replace yoink with nvim version:
https://github.com/gbprod/yanky.nvim

It might be possible to get completion in pml files (pymol language).
https://pymol.org/pymol-command-ref.html
It's essentially python where the parenthesis are removed and string arguments don't need quotation marks. Then it just top level calls pymol.cmd.* functions.
Would also be cool to make completion within strings that are selection algebra
https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Selection_Algebra
This can be useful for both .pml and .py meant for pymol.

Maybe prettier markdown
https://github.com/OXY2DEV/markview.nvim

Kitty now has ability to have window specific mappings, so e.g. something different happens when pressing something while in neovim vs outside it.
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/#conditional-mappings-depending-on-the-state-of-the-focused-window
It can also set kitty env vars from neovim.
We could make cmd+enter faster at toggling between REPL and editor by setting env var and not having to search for the other window each time.


Completion for kitty conf would be cool, e.g. parse
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/


tex:
align & in math align env and cases.
copy paste table content and reformat to/from tsv.

useful stuff from:
https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim

If you start using ghostty or if you want a more "correct" approach to dark/light switching in the future then consider
https://github.com/afonsofrancof/OSC11.nvim/

Decrease the intensity of hl-cursorline and thus the linked quickfix line hl group.
Do this after making a more dynamic setter of hl groups with color mixing, intensity setting etc.
