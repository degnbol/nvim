When opening a new ipython REPL with leader tT it doesn't activate the 
right env. Possibly because it doesn't understand autoenv.

TODO: improve julia LSP. Slow, doesn't have completion, e.g. mean from stats.
I think you need to understand some basics, watch tj on lsp servers, interact 
directly with julia lsp server to see if it works. Maybe set it up without any 
mason help.

TODO: error highlight it when I write choice node with string rather than node, 
e.g. `c(1, {"", ""})` when I should do `c(1, {t"", t""})`

FIXME: i_ctrl-x_ctrl-s gives spell suggestions, but adds +" for some reason.

FIXME: understand the runtime in terms of colorscheme etc. zshFunction and operator are linked to none.
We want to change them to link to function and operator. Some things in syntax/ 
are getting applied, things in after/syntax are not. We don't want options to 
be ignored, maybe by the double setting of the colorscheme.
NOTE: it sometimes helps to use `hi! default` instead of `hi`

FIXME: zsh. o understand correct indent, but == doesn't!
And fix having no colors. Either fix treesitter parsing of zsh or use some basic regex syntax.

<< moves cursor up 1 line if we are too close to line start.

Could browse files with

splitjoin shouldn't have issue splitting when there is a comment in a lua block for instance.

tex cmd trying to ctrl+t \texttt the whole text within an \href surrounds the whole \href cmd. It shouldnt.

You can toggle LSP diagnostics with:

Consider https://github.com/seblj/nvim-tabline and 
customized to use tabs rather than buffers

Delete button cuts, but should just delete. Fixed for backspace now using black hole register.

see video again from kitty main page and implement super useful things, e.g. the thing that let's you edit remote files locally.
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

Maybe move around vim and kitty windows more seamlessly
https://github.com/knubie/vim-kitty-navigator

Check out https://github.com/ms-jpq/isomorphic_copy
to deal with clipboard on remote. Ideally use kitty kittens tho.

Telescope filter underfull overfull and warnings in latex.

markid better syntax highlighting

Make writing guitar tabs easy. E.g. ability to convert from finger position as 100231 to a pretty version. And convenient way of editing
e|-0---------0-----|
B|-------2-------2-|
G|-----2-------2---|
D|-2-------2-------|
A|-----------------|
E|-----------------|

play with cypher syntax highlight.
Automatically uppercase cypher keywords like a spell check word replacement call?
Or make a command to toggle entire doc between uppercase and lowercase keywords.
It is nice that they are uppercase if you read without syntax highlighting but 
no need when they are colored. This applies to other query languages as well, 
sql for instance.

Checkout https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x53lzx/i_must_be_missing_something/

make tables in latex nice to edit, similar to tsv files.

make legendary listing of keybindings to also serve as help for remembering 
e.g. m[a-zA-Z] is mark, then `[a-zA-Z] or '[a-zA-Z] to go to mark or marked 
line.

features: leader+leader+p to toggle pipe notation in julia, leader+leader+i 
toggling between inline function, regular and begin/end and other toggles could 
be useful. Currently made some macros.

look more into editing remote files with nvim from local without using kitten for it.
Purpose:
1) browse the actual remote folder instead of a local temp folder.
2) indenpendence from kitty so we can use any terminal.

there seem to be some nice util functions you can use at https://gitlab.com/jrop/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/my/utils.lua#L27

consider if x and d should be swapped, since d's natural role is cut, so then only x will be non-standard.

Still not happy with autopairs. E.g. { at end of line where I have something on next line that I intend to put inside {}.
Or finishing an unclosed quote in lua seems like an obvious case not to introduce a new pair of "".

Would be cool if viv and vik could understand when = is inside arg and then do intersect of itself and via.
I downloaded the key/value text objs as a starting point in lua/textobjects/keyvalue.lua.

Custom completion sources, e.g. valid string values for ggplot, e.g. annotate and guide="none" or direction="vertical"
inspiration from youtuber showing custom cmp source:

conceal \textcolor in tex and show the contained color in the chosen color.

highlight _ that is outside math env with ERROR color in tex.

https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-cmdline
https://github.com/dmitmel/cmp-cmdline-history

autoswap for kitty? or just allow editing file in multiple windows.

consider:

Would be cool to only list dark or light themes in :Treesitter colorscheme.
I made a small temp solution with multiple user events but it doesn't deal with 
requiring plugins with both light and dark colorscheme or to unlist loaded ones later.

In case you want to auto switch comment (commentstring) in markdown with code 
sections:
https://dotfyle.com/plugins/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring

The U key. It undos all changes in the line. I have never used it.
We could remap to redo or something else more useful.
We can still have undo line by remapping Vu to undo line. 
Default for visual is lowercase and uppercase for u and U.
But the normal mode gu and gU works just fine as well and we again never use this.

I notice that block wise cut and paste works in --clean but not in my config without <leader>pb.

try out https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim
instead of leap

Injected code, e.g. in markdown or asciidoc. Treesitter should be able to 
handle this supposedly. I feel like I have something like this work at some 
point.

abb hic to Hi-C shouldn't happen in code, maybe have abbrevs you set for prose 
filetypes only or do something with snippets that only expand in prose or 
comments.

Should maybe write something more intelligent for brackets? e.g. df[:, [[|] 
doesn't expand to [] since it thinks we just pressed [ x3.

julia lua func or macro like @inline vs @function for toggling between pipe |> and regular ()

kittyREPL: don't do bracketed when not needed, e.g. for single line since it 
will be visible when REPL is too busy to parse. I often do e.g. <CR>} and I 
think you never need to empty lines, so those should be filtered out, and then 
we check whether one line is left. Still make sure a final newline is not 
discarded so python still runs things and doesn't start pasting.

add snippets or custom completion for writing luasnippets, reference:
https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md

Also, either find out how to have a snip replace the entire line, always, or 
write custom completion source that has more control, in order to do this.
Relevant for req/import/using statements etc that I generally write with one thing per line.

Hide search highlights by default except while actively searching, i.e. show 
when pressing n, but hide when pressing anything else.

Place LPS related commands such as restart under <leader>lr and place latex 
commands such as compile under <leader>cc or something that is consistently 
used for compilation. Then <leader>co for open, or v for view or p for preview idk.
Then we can make it more explicit which tool is used, e.g. t for treesitter things.
If you want to have a place to put filetype local things (like align table for 
latex), then <leader><leader> could be good as a prefix.

FIXME: vmap x doesn't allow =p

I think some of the julia cool things you want like convert string to/from 
symbol, inline vs not inline function etc are what are called code actions.
https://old.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/16v32p5/clearactionnvim_makes_lsp_code_actions/

Would be cool to have essentially zsh/bash LSP, where gf works for paths even 
if they are using env variables defined in the same script or if using e.g. 
"`git root`/src/hello.jl"

FIXME: slow while scrolling, e.g. ~/Topology/Chromatin/Pub/Su_2020/hicVsImg.jl

<leader>s split should also understand then...end in lua

Low priority. Forward and reverse search in typst inspired by vimtex.

Don't progress to next line when running current line in REPL.

If possible, make the kitty run cmds send q to julia REPL first, if pager is detected.
