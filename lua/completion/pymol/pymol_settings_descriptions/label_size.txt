<p>Sets how large the labels are rendered. You can use positive numbers 2, 3, 4, etc for point sizes, or negative numbers for Angstrom-based sizes. Default is 14 points. Labels in Angstrom-size scale with the distance from the front plane, labels in point-size don't. This automatic scaling works with the <a href="/index.php/Draw" title="Draw">draw</a> command but not with the <a href="/index.php/Ray" title="Ray">ray</a> command.
