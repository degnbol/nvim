When set \"on\", this setting causes PyMOL to \"auto_zoom\" to any new
object upon loading. This is helpful when one wishes to look at a new
object immediately upon loading it into your PyMOL session; it can also
be vexing in the situation where you have a carefully constructed view
that might be \"lost\" if you do not anticipate that the program will
change the view on loading an additional object. If you opt to use
\"auto_zoom on\", it is also wise to get in the habit of frequent
session saves and also use of \"scenes\" and the \"get_view\" utility,
which will save one\'s current view orientation matrix to the
(temporary) memory cache. The \'default\' behavior (ON) can be
overridden by placing the \"set auto_zoom, off\" statement into your
\'.pymolrc\' file, located in your login directory (under all flavors of
unix).
