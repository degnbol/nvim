Sets how large the labels are rendered. You can use positive numbers 2,
3, 4, etc for point sizes, or negative numbers for Angstrom-based sizes.
Default is 14 points. Labels in Angstrom-size scale with the distance
from the front plane, labels in point-size don\'t. This automatic
scaling works with the [draw](/index.php/Draw "Draw") command but not
with the [ray](/index.php/Ray "Ray") command.
