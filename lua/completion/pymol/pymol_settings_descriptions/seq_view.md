The **seq_view** command turns the sequence viewer on and off. The
sequence viewer is a very handy tool, you can use it for example to
select residues very easily. When the sequence viewer is turned on, you
can select individual residues or multiple residues by selecting
residues, using the mouse, on the sequence viewer.

*Note:* The sequence viewer, seems to decrease PyMOL\'s
[performance](/index.php/Category:Performance "Category:Performance")
when very many proteins are loaded into PyMOL. Therefore, if you have
many proteins loaded, turn off the sequence viewer to increase
performance if you don\'t need the viewer. You can remedy this, by
turning on [texture_fonts](/index.php/Texture_fonts "Texture fonts").
Simply do,
