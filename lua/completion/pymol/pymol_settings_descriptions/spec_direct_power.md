This controls the direct specular power. Essentially, this is how
strongly surfaces that are perpendicular to the ray drawn from the
camera are rendered. The features seems to be inversely proportional to
the value. Typical values here range from \[0, 200+\].

This image shows the spec_direct_power setting increasing **from** 0
**to** 100.
