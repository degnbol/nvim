The setting \"stick_ball_ratio\" controls the relative ratio between the
radius of sticks connecting bonded atoms and the radius of the atom
spheres. Note that simply setting \"stick_ball, on\" will result in
balls with the same radius as the sticks and so will appear only
slightly different (the joins will be smoother). Changing the
stick_ball_ratio without setting \"stick_ball, on\" will \-- obviously
\-- have no apparent effect.
