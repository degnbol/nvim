**This setting is deprecated in v1.5 and later as it is always
enabled.**

The setting \"stick_ball\" controls whether bonded atoms are shown
simply as joined sticks (set stick_ball, off) or as traditional
\"ball-and-stick\" representation (set stick_ball, on). Note that simply
setting stick_ball on will result in balls with the same radius as the
sticks and so will appear only slightly different (the joins will be
smoother).
