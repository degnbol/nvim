This defines the solvent radius. Changing the solvent radius in PyMOL
affects how PyMOL interprets
[surfaces](/index.php/Surface_solvent "Surface solvent"), [surface
area](/index.php/Displaying_Biochemical_Properties#Surface-Related "Displaying Biochemical Properties").

The default solvent radius is 1.4 Angstroms.
