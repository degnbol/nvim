[ray_texture_settings]{.mw-selflink .selflink} controls the wobble and
wiggle settings for texturing. Playing with these settings can produce
interesting effects. The values take on different meaning for each
[ray_texture](/index.php/Ray_texture "Ray texture") type. For example,
if ray_texture is set to 3, then the three values are the power of the
circular shift in X, Y, and Z directions.

In this example below, ray_texture=2, and ray_texture_settings=5 10 10.
