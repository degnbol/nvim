set [cavity_cull]{.mw-selflink .selflink} allows the user to define how
sensitive pymol it to detecting cavities within the interior of a
molecule. Smaller cavities are not detected as the cavity cull value is
increased. The value *may* correspond in angstroms a dimension of the
cavity approximately.
