This setting affects the radius of sticks in the sticks representation.
Default scale is set to 0.25.

In newer versions of PyMOL, one may set the [Stick_radius]{.mw-selflink
.selflink} on a per-bond basis. So, you can set for example, the radius
of only selected bonds if you want. This is done through the
[Set_bond](/index.php/Set_bond "Set bond") command.
