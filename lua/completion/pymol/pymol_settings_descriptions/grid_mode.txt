<p><b>grid_mode</b> partitions the screen into a grid and displays each molecule in one grid location.  Each molecule rotates, zooms, etc in that grid.    A possibly very useful option for PyMOL.  Each grid area is assigned a <a href="/index.php/Grid_slot" title="Grid slot">grid_slot</a> number.  This allows you to assign objects to certain grids; very helpful.  This can be useful when comparing homologous structures and you want to view and rotate the aligned structures side by side.  This is similar to a multiple split screen view of the proteins.
</p><p><b>Hint:</b> When using grid_mode with many molecules, it's sometimes good to align their centers of mass.  This puts them all squarely in the middle of their grid element.  The <b>alignto</b> command from <a href="/index.php/Cealign" title="Cealign">cealign</a> can do this for you.
