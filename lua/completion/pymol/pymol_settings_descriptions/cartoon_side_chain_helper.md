set **cartoon_side_chain_helper** is an easy way, in cartoon mode, to
only show the side chain of a residue.

For residues represented in [cartoon](/index.php/Cartoon "Cartoon") (but
not [ribbon](/index.php/Ribbon "Ribbon")) form, if you show the residue
also in [stick](/index.php/Sticks "Sticks") or wireframe
**cartoon_side_chain_helper** hides backbone atoms. Showing the
sidechain in this method distorts the cartoon shape so it joins with the
sidechain, effectively over-riding any
[cartoon_flat_cycles](/index.php/Cartoon_flat_cycles "Cartoon flat cycles")
setting for that residue.
