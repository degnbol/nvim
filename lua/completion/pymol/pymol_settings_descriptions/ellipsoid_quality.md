This setting determines how much refinement PyMOL uses in rendering
ellipsoids. Other
[representations](/index.php/Category:Representations "Category:Representations")
have similar settings. The most often used is
[Surface_quality](/index.php/Surface_quality "Surface quality").

This set to 0 is a rough approximation. Higher values, like 1, 2, 3 make
truer representations.
