Look even nerdier in front of your friends ! set internal_prompt,f !

internal_prompt turns the internal \'PyMOL\>\' prompt on or off. The
typed commands are not seen anymore, unless you use the esc toggle,
which allows you as usual to see the console dialogue. The last line of
verbose is still visible where the command line used to be.
