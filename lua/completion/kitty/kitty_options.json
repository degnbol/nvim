For example::\n\n    # Reset the terminal\n    map f1 clear_terminal reset active\n    # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents\n    map f1 clear_terminal clear active\n    # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it\n    map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active\n    # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback\n    map f1 clear_terminal scroll active\n    # Clear everything on screen up to the line with the cursor or the start of the current prompt (needs shell integration)\n    map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active\n    # Same as above except cleared lines are moved into scrollback\n    map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active\n    # Erase the last command and its output (needs shell integration to work)\n    map f1 clear_terminal last_command active\n\nIf you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the current one, use\n:italic:`all` instead of :italic:`active`.\n\nSome useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files to perform various kinds of\nclearing of the current window:\n\n\n\n    clear-only-screen() {\n        printf \"\\e[H\\e[2J\"\n    }\n\n    clear-screen-and-scrollback() {\n        printf \"\\e[H\\e[3J\"\n    }\n\n    clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {\n        printf \"\\e[H\\e[22J\"\n    }\n\nFor instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap Ctrl+L\nto both scroll the current screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear\nthe screen, instead of just clearing the screen. For ZSH, in /.zshrc, add:\n\n\n\n    ctrl_l() {\n        builtin print -rn -- $'\\r\\e[0J\\e[H\\e[22J' >\"$TTY\"\n        builtin zle .reset-prompt\n        builtin zle -R\n    }\n    zle -N ctrl_l\n    bindkey '^l' ctrl_l\n\nAlternatively, you can just add map ctrl+l clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active to kitty.conf which\nworks with no changes to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does not clear any text at the prompt itself."
