Make julia LSP faster with https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md#julials

If you want to be able to open nvim within nvim terminal it can be done without nesting: https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote see bottom of https://github.com/caenrique/nvim-toggle-terminal
Consider https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R and https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline
